Only 28% of U.S. adults rate economic conditions as excellent or good, while 72% describe them as fair or poor, the survey found. Those numbers are little changed since last fall and remain well below levels seen before the COVID-19 pandemic. The nationwide survey of 8,512 adults, conducted Jan. 20–26, found that concerns about everyday costs dominate Americans’ economic worries. About 71% said they are very concerned about the cost of health care, 66% cited the price of food and consumer goods, and 62% pointed to housing costs. Views of the economy remain sharply divided by party. Nearly half of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 49%, now rate the economy positively — the highest level of Trump’s second term. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, just 10% say the economy is in excellent or good shape. Americans are also split on where the economy is headed. About 38% expect conditions to be worse a year from now, while 31% think they will improve and 30% expect little change. Republicans are far more optimistic, with 57% expecting improvement, compared with just 8% of Democrats. When asked about Trump’s economic policies, 52% of adults said they have made economic conditions worse. Another 28% said the policies have improved the economy, while 19% said they have had little effect. A majority of Republicans, 57%, said Trump’s policies have made conditions better, while 85% of Democrats said they have made them worse. The survey also found broad opposition to the administration’s tariff increases. Six in ten Americans disapprove of substantially higher tariffs on imports, including nearly four in ten who strongly disapprove. Republicans largely support the tariffs, while Democrats overwhelmingly oppose them. Pew researchers said the findings show that while Republican confidence has grown, overall economic sentiment remains negative, driven by persistent worries over prices and household costs.

    "detailed_summary": "Pew Research Centerの最新調査によると、トランプ大統領の第2期就任から1年が経過しても、アメリカ国民の72%が経済状況を否定的と評価している。ヘルスケア、食料、住宅費の高騰が主要な経済的懸念事項であり、これらの数値はパンデミック前の水準を大きく下回っている。経済への見方は党派間で二分されており、共和党支持者は比較的楽観的な一方、民主党支持者は悲観的で、トランプ政権の経済政策や関税引き上げに対する評価も大きく割れている。共和党支持者の自信は高まるも、全体として物価上昇への根強い懸念から、国民の経済感情は依然として悲観的である。",
    "why_it_matters": "この調査は、アメリカ国民の経済に対する根強い不満と、その認識が党派間で大きく異なる現状を浮き彫りにしている。これは今後の政治的議論や政策形成、さらには社会の分断状況を理解する上で重要である。"
